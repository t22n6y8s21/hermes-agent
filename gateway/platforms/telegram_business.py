"""Telegram Business Mode (Secretary Bots) — owner-approved drafting.

When a Telegram Business account owner connects this bot via BotFather's
Business Mode, the bot starts receiving messages addressed to the owner
in chats the owner has whitelisted. This module turns those incoming
customer messages into drafted replies that the owner approves before
they go out — no auto-send, ever.

User flow (the simplest path that works end-to-end):

  1. Owner enables Business Mode in BotFather and connects this bot.
     → bot receives ``BusinessConnection`` update, persists it, DMs the
     owner an onboarding message with a quick how-it-works summary.

  2. Customer messages the owner in a chat covered by the connection.
     → bot debounces ``debounce_seconds`` (default 8s) to coalesce
     typing bursts, then drafts a single reply using the most-recent
     customer text.
     → bot DMs the draft to the *owner's* chat with this bot, with
     inline buttons: [✓ Send]  [✎ Edit]  [✕ Discard].

  3. Owner taps:
       Send    → bot sends the draft to the customer chat using
                 ``business_connection_id``. Owner gets a "✓ Sent" confirmation.
       Edit    → bot replies "send me the text you want delivered" and
                 captures the owner's next text DM as the outgoing reply.
       Discard → draft dropped, nothing goes to the customer.

The owner is always in control: ``can_reply`` from Telegram is required
for the Send button to appear, ``/biz pause`` globally suspends drafting,
and per-chat pauses live in ``telegram_business_connections.paused_chats``.

State lives in two SQLite tables (``telegram_business_connections`` and
``telegram_business_drafts``) created lazily on first use by
``SessionDB.apply_telegram_business_migration()``. See ``hermes_state.py``
for the schema.

This module is glued onto ``gateway/platforms/telegram.py`` via three
PTB update handlers plus an inline-button callback prefix (``bd:`` for
"business draft"). The host adapter owns all Telegram I/O — this module
just calls back into it for sending.
